=============
Compose models using graphs, backed by graph db or NoSQL db. 

This is useful when building apps that:
- Most models have ModelType fields
- Have models with compound fields (List, Dict) and lazy loading is needed
- Most of the models have many-to-many relationships
- Relationship traversal and query are important
